# __The-Cartesian-product-automaton__
**this project for prodect two automata but the automata structer is :**

- **states:** it's an  array of atats in automata ,the its color in plot is black 
- **labels:** it's an array of labels of edges in automata
- __transitions:__ this is an array of transitions between states in automata as [from_state ,to_state,by_label ]
- **initial_state:** it's the start state of the automata ,the its color in plot is green
- **finaly_states:** it's an array of finaly states of the automata ,the its color in plot is red
